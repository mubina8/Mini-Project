    <string name="text">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
        The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell. \n \n Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.\n\nRecommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, social distancing (maintaining distance from others), and keeping hands away from the face.The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they have the virus and their caregivers, but not the general public.There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Management involves treatment of symptoms, supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.</string>
